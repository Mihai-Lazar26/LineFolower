# Line follower robot project

#### Task:

Build a robot which resembles a little car and uses infrared light sensors to detect a black line on a white surface and continues following it by giving appropriate power to each of the two motors using PID control mechanism.

#### Components:
  * Arduino Uno microcontroller board
  * Breadboard
  * 3D printed chassis
  * Ball caster
  * QTR-8A reflectance sensor array
  * DC motor (x2)
  * L293D motor driver
  * Wheel (x2)
  * LiPo battery
  * Wires
